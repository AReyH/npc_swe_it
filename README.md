# IT - Software Engineering Committee

Welcome to the repository for live demos and hands-on learning projects created by members of the IT - Software Engineering Committee.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a shared space for:
- Running **live demos** during internal committee sessions
- Experimenting with **new technologies, patterns, and tools**

## Audience

This repo is intended for:
- IT crew within our company who are part of or interested in the Software Engineering Committee

## Structure

Each project/demo should live in its own folder and include:
- A `README.md` file explaining the goal and setup
- All necessary code and dependencies
- Notes or slides if the demo accompanies a presentation

Example structure:
/
├── project-a/
│ ├── README.md
│ └── ...
├── project-b/
│ ├── README.md
│ └── ...
└── README.md


## Getting Started

To contribute a new demo:
1. Create an Issue and a branch with a concise name.
2. Create a new folder with a clear and concise name.
3. Add your code and a `README.md` inside your folder.
4. Submit a pull request with a short description of your demo.

> Note: Keep each project self-contained and well-documented for future reference.

## Collaboration Guidelines

- Keep it simple: These are learning projects.
- Respect others’ demos, feel free to explore, but don’t modify others’ work without discussing first.
- Share knowledge! Add links, references, or lessons learned in your demo README.
